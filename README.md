##Elyssa 0.5
Elyssa is a project to make simple program that can solve elementary physics problems.

###Sample Problem
*A 10g bullet is fired from a gun. If the recoil velocity is 5m/s and the mass of the gun is 2kg, find the velocity of the bullet.*

####Input
*Number of Knowns*=`5`
*Write them one at a line*
`m1 = 0.01`
`m2 = 2`
`u1 = 0`
`u2 = 0`
`v2 = 5`
*What to find=* `v1`
*-1000*
